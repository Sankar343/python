# python
In this code, we first define the binary_search function as before.
We then take input from the user for the size of the array n, the array elements arr, and the element to search for x.

We call the binary_search function with arr and x, and store the result in the variable result.
Finally, we print the value of result to show the index of x in the array, or -1 if it wasn't found.
